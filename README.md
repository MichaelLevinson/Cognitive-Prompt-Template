# Cognitive Prompt Template

## Description

This repository provides a structured Cognitive Prompting Template for problem-solving with AI. The template is designed to guide both users and AI systems through a sequence of cognitive operations, enabling clear, systematic, and effective problem decomposition and solution synthesis.

## Cognitive Prompting Template

When requesting prompts, apply the following template:

1. **Goal Clarification:**  
   Prompt: "What is the primary objective or outcome needed to achieve with this problem?"  
   (AI response should clearly state the goal)

2. **Decomposition:**  
   Prompt: "Break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps. What are the key components or tasks needed to reach the goal?"  
   (AI response should list the sub-tasks or components)

3. **Filtering:**  
   Prompt: "From the given information, what are the most relevant details that directly relate to each of the decomposed steps?"  
   (AI response should filter out unnecessary information and highlight the important details)

4. **Pattern Recognition:**  
   Prompt: "Are there any patterns or relationships within the relevant information that can help guide the problem-solving process?"  
   (AI response should identify patterns, trends, or similar scenarios)

5. **Reorganization (Optional):**  
   Prompt: "Can the information or variables be reorganized to simplify the problem or make the patterns more evident?"  
   (AI response should present the data in a more logical or structured way)

6. **Abstraction (Optional):**  
   Prompt: "Based on the identified patterns, what are the broader principles or generalizations that can be applied to solve this problem?"  
   (AI response should extract the core concepts or rules)

7. **Generalization (Optional):**  
   Prompt: "How can these abstracted principles be applied to the broader problem or similar contexts to generalize the solution?"  
   (AI response should explain how the insights can be used in other situations)

8. **Integration:**  
   Prompt: "Synthesize the insights gathered from the previous steps. How can all the relevant information and principles be integrated to arrive at a cohesive solution?"  
   (AI response should combine the findings into a comprehensive solution)

9. **Final Answer:**  
   Prompt: "Based on the cognitive process that was followed, what is the final answer or solution to the problem?"  
   (AI response should provide the final answer)

**Important Notes:**
- This template offers a framework, and the prompts and cognitive operations can be adjusted based on the specific problem being solved.
- Some steps, like Reorganization, Abstraction, and Generalization, might not be necessary for every problem.
- This template can be used for static cognitive prompting (following a fixed sequence) or reflective cognitive prompting (allowing the AI to choose the sequence).
- Domain-specific adaptations of cognitive operations can be crucial for enhancing effectiveness.
